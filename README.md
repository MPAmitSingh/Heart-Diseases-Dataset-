Project : 9 - Heart Diseases Dataset EDA

🔍 Exploring Heart Disease with EDA: Unveiling Patterns and Insights 🔍

I'm thrilled to share that I’ve just wrapped up an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart disease datasets, leveraging powerful libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project helped me dive deep into data-driven decision-making and uncover critical insights. 🚀

Here are some of the key techniques and visualizations I applied:

-⚙️ Data Wrangling & Exploration:
unique(), nunique(), value_counts() for initial data understanding.
groupby() for aggregating data and spotting trends across features.

-📈 Visualizations & Insights:
Univariate Analysis:- distplot(), kdeplot() to analyze distributions.
Categorical Analysis:- countplot(), catplot() to study categorical data.
Bivariate Analysis:- scatterplot(), stripplot(), boxplot() for variable comparisons.

-🔥 Advanced Data Exploration:
Correlation Analysis:- Using corr() and heatmap() to identify relationships between variables.
Pairplot:- To visualize multi-dimensional interactions.

Key takeaways include identifying potential risk factors and understanding the distribution of heart disease across various age groups, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. 💡

This project was an incredible opportunity to sharpen my EDA skills, from handling missing data to mastering insightful visualizations. 🎯

A huge shoutout to KODI PRAKASH SENAPATI for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. 🙏 Your insights were crucial in shaping my approach!

I’m excited to bring these skills into future projects and continue growing in the field of data science! 💼
