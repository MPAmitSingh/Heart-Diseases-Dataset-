Project : 9 - Heart Diseases Dataset EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset ðŸ’”

I am sharing my recent project on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset. Given that cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, this analysis provides meaningful insights into the data.

The project involves a detailed examination of the dataset to identify key patterns and insights. The analysis covers the following:

-Introduction to EDA: Explaining its significance and objectives.

-Data Overview: Steps for importing, previewing, and summarizing the dataset.
-Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual features to understand their distribution and properties.
-Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between variables and their impact on the target feature.
-Multivariate Analysis: Using heat maps and pair plots to understand complex interactions.
-Handling Missing Values: Techniques to detect and manage missing data.
-Outlier Detection: Identifying and assessing anomalies that could affect the analysis.

The project includes all the code and findings in detail. I hope this analysis proves to be informative and useful.

A special thanks to KODI PRAKASH SENAPATI for the guidance and support throughout this project.

I appreciate any feedback or support.
